Our solution addresses the critical issue of toxic gas like benzene accumulation                                                                                                  inside cars parked under direct sunlight. When exposed to high temperatures, car interiors like seat ,dashboard can release harmful gases like benzene, into the cabin. To overcome this, we propose a system that integrates a sensitive gas sensor with a modified AC vent. The gas sensor, installed inside the car, continuously monitors air quality and detects harmful gases at unsafe levels. Upon detection, the system automatically activates the exhaust fan that is embeded with the ac vent. Instead of  circulating air within the cabin, this vent actively sucks in the contaminated air and expels it outside the vehicle, ensuring the interior remains safe and breathable. Our system is designed to integrate easily with existing vehicle components, making it adaptable for a wide range of cars with minimal modifications. By implementing this technology, we aim to enhance passenger safety and protect against the long-term health risks associated with toxic gas exposure, making it a valuable addition to modern vehicle safety features.
